**Customer Churn Prediction for Credit Card Services**
**Project Overview**
The marketing team of our bank is facing a significant challenge: increasing customer churn rates in our credit card services. 
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning so that proactive measures can be taken to retain them. 
This is a classification problem, aimed at reducing the overall churn rate.

**Problem Statement**
The marketing team is concerned about the increasing churn rates, which can lead to a loss of revenue and market share for the bank. 
To mitigate this, we need to accurately predict which customers are likely to churn.

**Objectives**
•	Predictive Modeling: Develop a model to predict which customers are at risk of churning.
•	Proactive Retention: Enable the marketing team to take proactive measures, such as offering incentives or personalized services, to retain customers.
•	Data-Driven Insights: Use data analysis techniques to identify patterns and factors associated with customer churn.

**Methodology**
1.	Data Collection: Gather data on customer behavior, demographics, transaction history, and other relevant factors.
2.	Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the data distribution and identify important features.
4.	Feature Engineering: Create new features that may help improve the model's performance.
5.	Model Selection: Experiment with various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests.
6.	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
7.	Model Tuning: Fine-tune the model parameters to optimize performance.
   
**Technologies Used**
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
•	Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest


**Results**
The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify churn customers, enabling the bank to take appropriate actions to retain them and reduce overall churn rates.
